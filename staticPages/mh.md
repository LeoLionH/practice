**Briefing:** A friend wanted to create a UI that could take a users thoughts and help them to recognise common cognitive distortions such as Catastrophizing, Black-and-white thinking and Jumping to conclusions. 

H﻿is ultimate goal was to create a prototype he could use to speak to counsellors and mental health professionals, so they he could build out a more fully-featured site with their assistance. 

**U﻿I:** We started with some basic wireframe sketches drawn during a brain storming session. These would form the basis for the approach to collection information.

T﻿he next stage was to build this out into some interactive wireframes. For this I used lucidchart.
