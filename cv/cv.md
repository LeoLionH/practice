    As a Product Manager, I'm passionate about delivering the most intuitive and
    accessible user experiences for both B2B and B2C audiences.



    I believe in data-led decision making, collecting market research, user testing and analytics to build and then iterate on a product.



    I take pride in being able to take complex problems and translate them into simple concepts that my team can deliver and our clients can understand.



    As a result, the teams I run consistently deliver sprints and roadmap features through clear communication, effective planning and a culture of shared ownership.
